# Cobblemon Emergence

This repository contains the metadata for Cobblemon Emergence, along with a
work-in-progress custom launcher to manage updates.

Cobblemon Emergence is a pack for Minecraft 1.20.1, aimed at creating 
exploration heavy gameplay, with progress dictated by the ease at which 
exploration is possible. This is in contrast to vanilla Minecraft, which 
traditionally makes traversal and exploration extremely easy, and where 
as such- progress is, typically, defined by stat increases.
